A guide on the prework study course. This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.


- What was your motivation? I wanted to see how capable I was in learing how to code.
- Why did you build this project? I have built this project to use a simple guide for my notes while I study coding.
- What problem does it solve? It will help refresh the steps I need to take when accomplishing future projects in code
- What did you learn? I learn that Html is a programming langauge to built the foundation of a webnsite. That CSS is a language which provides the design the end user will see such as, fonts, colours, shapes. Javacript or JS is used to control the way an different elements behave. And Git in used for Version Control. It tracks all the changes that are made to the coding files. It also serves as a easier way to collaborate on a single project without making crucial errors to your teams code.
